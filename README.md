# Conformal-Prediction-Cpmparison


## Overview
This repository contains scripts for conducting conformal prediction analysis, aiming to evaluate the robustness and reliability of prediction intervals generated by various statistical models under different data conditions. Used with python 3.10 on MacOS.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikeras`
- `tensorflow`
- `mapie`

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The `DATA_Preparation.py` script processes real data. In this case from UCI Machinelearning repository.

2. **Run Real Data**: The `Run_Real_Data.py` script applies conformal prediction methods to the prepared real data, evaluating the performance of these methods.

3. **Several Runs**: The `Several_Runs.py` script is designed to perform multiple runs on simulated data. ( heteroscedacity, homoscedacity, heteroscedacity with sparse data)

4. **Single Run**: The `Single_Run.py` script focuses on a detailed single run analysis, providing deeper insights with additional metrics.
